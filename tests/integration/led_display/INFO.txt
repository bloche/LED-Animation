This is a test for integration of the Video Stream Interface and the LED 
Panel Interface of this project.

This set of files is designed to run on the Raspberry Pi with team RPLD's
display drivers installed on. Note that Qt and OpenCV must be installed 
on the local machine, and any relative path to dependant files / directories
must be resolved before compilation will succeed. 

video.pro is the qmake build file for this test.
